# I590 Big Data Software - Final Project
- Student Name: Ji Ma

### Description of Project

This project will complete the following tasks:
- Deploy the Big Data Stack following the official documents;
- Use Ansible Playbook to install Python packages (i.e., networkx and pandas) on VMs for network analysis;
- Use Ansible Playbook to download the 100 csv files (dataset hosted on my own website) and put them onto HDFS;
- Use Ansible Playbook to download the python script for analysis (script wrote by myself and hosted on my own website), and then run the analysis script.

### Results
After the analysis (takes about 3 minutes), 100 GraphML files can be obtained and stored under /tmp/graphs directory in the fronthead VM.
